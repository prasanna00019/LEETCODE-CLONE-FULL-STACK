# LeetCode FullStack Clone

A full-stack LeetCode-inspired platform designed for coding practice, problem-solving, and performance tracking. Built using the MERN stack, this project replicates core features of the original platform, delivering a seamless and interactive experience for users.

## Features
- **Problem Browsing**: Explore a library of algorithmic challenges categorized by difficulty and topic.
- **Code Editor**: Integrated code editor with real-time execution for testing solutions.

- **User Submissions**: Track user submissions and performance history.
- **Performance Tracking**: View detailed stats to monitor progress and improve coding skills.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js for building an interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **Backend**: Node.js and Express for handling user authentication, problem fetching, and code execution.
- **Database**: MongoDB for efficient data storage and retrieval.

## Key Highlights
- Implemented a robust backend API for handling:
  - User authentication and authorization.
  - Problem fetching and submission processing.
  - Code execution and test result validation.
- Leveraged **React** for dynamic UI components and a responsive user experience.
- Demonstrated expertise in full-stack development using **MERN stack** technologies.
